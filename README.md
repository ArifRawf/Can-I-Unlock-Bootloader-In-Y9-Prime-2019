`Huawei Y9 Prime (2019)` is the first pop-up selfie camera phone manufactured by Huawei. The big advantage of this design is that we are going to have a max vision `6.59` inches display. It means more comfortable viewing experience and of course a good news for perfectionists that the annoying tiny notch is finally gone. The motorized pop-up front camera looks stylish and facny. The back side comes with an elegant gradient design which looks quite premium. However, the material is plastic. The display has some sort of light protection, but there is no Gorilla Glass certification. So, if you want to feel fully confident, you should buy an extra protection for the display. Full `HD+` LTPS IPS LCD quality should feel excellent to look at.


**This Phone has a powerful custom rom and Security where you cant unlock bootloader and root this phone**.
